                    <li><a href="#" data-title="Dataware House Introduction " data-content="A Data Warehouse is separate from DBMS, it stores a huge amount of data, which is typically collected from multiple heterogeneous sources like files, DBMS, etc.  The goal is to produce statistical results that may help in decision-making. For example, a college might want to see quick different results, like how the placement of CS students has improved over the last 10 years, in terms of salaries, counts, etc.  
                         
                    An ordinary Database can store MBs to GBs of data and that too for a specific purpose. For storing data of TB size, the storage shifted to the Data Warehouse. Besides this, a transactional database doesn’t offer itself to analytics. To effectively perform analytics, an organization keeps a central Data Warehouse to closely study its business by organizing, understanding, and using its historical data for making strategic decisions and analyzing trends. 
                    Better business analytics: Data warehouse plays an important role in every business to store and analysis of all the past data and records of the company. which can further increase the understanding or analysis of data for the company.
                    Faster Queries: The data warehouse is designed to handle large queries that’s why it runs queries faster than the database.
                    Improved data Quality: In the data warehouse the data you gathered from different sources is being stored and analyzed it does not interfere with or add data by itself so your quality of data is maintained and if you get any issue regarding data quality then the data warehouse team will solve this.

                        Building a Data Warehouse – Some steps that are needed for building any data warehouse are as following below:
                        
                        To extract the data (transnational) from different data sources: For building a data warehouse, a data is extracted from various data sources and that data is stored in central storage area. For extraction of the data Microsoft has come up with an excellent tool. When you purchase Microsoft SQL Server, then this tool will be available at free of cost.
                        To transform the transnational data: There are various DBMS where many of the companies stores their data. Some of them are: MS Access, MS SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase etc. Also these companies saves the data in spreadsheets, flat files, mail systems etc. Relating a data from all these sources is done while building a data warehouse.

Data Models provide us with a transparent picture of data which helps us in creating an actual database. It shows us from the design of the data to its proper implementation of data.

                        Types of Relational Models
                        Conceptual Data Model

                        Data modeling is the process of developing data model for the data to be stored in a Database.
                    Data Models ensure consistency in naming conventions, default values, semantics, security while ensuring quality of the data.
                    Data Model structure helps to define the relational tables, primary and foreign keys and stored procedures.
                    There are three types of conceptual, logical, and physical.
                    The main aim of conceptual model is to establish the entities, their attributes, and their relationships.
                    Logical data model defines the structure of the data elements and set the relationships between them.">

                    <li><a href="#" data-title="Network Security Introduction" data-content="Network security is defined as the activity created to protect the integrity of your network and data. Every company or organization that handles a large amount of data, has a degree of solutions against many cyber threats. 

                        Any action intended to safeguard the integrity and usefulness of your data and network is known as network security. This is a broad, all-encompassing phrase that covers software and hardware solutions, as well as procedures, guidelines, and setups for network usage, accessibility, and general threat protection.
                        
                        The most basic example of Network Security is password protection which the user of the network chooses. In recent times, Network Security has become the central topic of cyber security with many organizations inviting applications from people who have skills in this area. The network security solutions protect various vulnerabilities of the computer systems such as:
                        
                        Users
                        Locations
                        Data
                        Devices
                        Applications">Introduction</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#" data-title="Types of Network Security" data-content="There are several types of network security through which we can make our network more secure, Your network and data are shielded from breaches, invasions, and other dangers by network security. Here below are some important types of network security:

                        1. Email Security
                        The most common danger vector for a security compromise is email gateways. Hackers create intricate phishing campaigns using recipients’ personal information and social engineering techniques to trick them and direct them to malicious websites. To stop critical data from being lost, an email security programme restricts outgoing messages and stops incoming threats.
                        
                        2. Firewalls
                        Your trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, like the Internet, are separated by firewalls. They control traffic by enforcing a set of predetermined rules. A firewall may consist of software, hardware, or both.
                        
                        3. Network Segmentation
                        Network traffic is divided into several categories by software-defined segmentation, which also facilitates the enforcement of security regulations. Ideally, endpoint identity—rather than just IP addresses—is the basis for the classifications. To ensure that the appropriate amount of access is granted to the appropriate individuals and that suspicious devices are controlled and remediated, access permissions can be assigned based on role, location, and other factors.
                        
                        4. Access Control
                        Your network should not be accessible to every user. You need to identify every user and every device in order to keep out any attackers. You can then put your security policies into effect. Noncompliant endpoint devices might either have their access restricted or blocked. Network access control (NAC) is this process.">Types of Network Security</a></li>

                    <li><a href="#" data-title="Benefits & Working" data-content="Network Security has several benefits, some of which are mentioned below:

                        Network Security helps in protecting clients’ information and data which ensures reliable access and helps in protecting the data from cyber threats.
                        Network Security protects the organization from heavy losses that may have occurred from data loss or any security incident.
                        It overall protects the reputation of the organization as it protects the data and confidential items.

                        Working on Network Security

                        The basic principle of network security is protecting huge stored data and networks in layers that ensure the bedding of rules and regulations that have to be acknowledged before performing any activity on the data.

It can be used in various places like schools, hospitals, buildings, roads, etc for various applications like disaster management, security management, crisis management, etc. There are 2 types of architecture used in WSN: Layered Network Architecture, and Clustered Architecture. These are explained as following below. 1. Layered Network Architecture: Layered Network Architecture makes use of a few hundred sensor nodes and a single powerful base station. Network nodes are organized into concentric Layers. It consists of 5 layers and three cross layers. The 5 layers are:

                        Power Management Plane
                        Mobility Management Plane
                        Task Management Plane
                        It is a 2-tier hierarchy clustering architecture.
                        It is a distributed algorithm for organizing the sensor nodes into groups called clusters.
                        The cluster head nodes in each of the autonomously formed clusters create the Time-division multiple access (TDMA) schedules.
                        It makes use of the concept called Data Fusion which makes it energy efficient.">Introduction</a></li>

                    <li><a href="#" data-title="Introduction" data-content="A distributed database is basically a database that is not limited to one system, it is spread over different sites, i.e, on multiple computers or over a network of computers. A distributed database system is located on various sites that don’t share physical components. This may be required when a particular database needs to be accessed by various users globally. It needs to be managed such that for the users it looks like one single database. 

                        Types: 
                        
                        1. Homogeneous Database: 
                        In a homogeneous database, all different sites store database identically. The operating system, database management system, and the data structures used – all are the same at all sites. Hence, they’re easy to manage. 
                        
                        2. Heterogeneous Database: 
                        In a heterogeneous distributed database, different sites can use different schema and software that can lead to problems in query processing and transactions. Also, a particular site might be completely unaware of the other sites. Different computers may use a different operating system, different database application. They may even use different data models for the database. Hence, translations are required for different sites to communicate. ">Introduction</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#" data-title="Distributed Data Storage" data-content="There are 2 ways in which data can be stored on different sites. These are: 

                        1. Replication –
                        In this approach, the entire relationship is stored redundantly at 2 or more sites. If the entire database is available at all sites, it is a fully redundant database. Hence, in replication, systems maintain copies of data. 
                        
                        This is advantageous as it increases the availability of data at different sites. Also, now query requests can be processed in parallel. 
                        However, it has certain disadvantages as well. Data needs to be constantly updated. Any change made at one site needs to be recorded at every site that relation is stored or else it may lead to inconsistency. This is a lot of overhead. Also, concurrency control becomes way more complex as concurrent access now needs to be checked over a number of sites. 
                        
                        2. Fragmentation –
                        In this approach, the relations are fragmented (i.e., they’re divided into smaller parts) and each of the fragments is stored in different sites where they’re required. It must be made sure that the fragments are such that they can be used to reconstruct the original relation (i.e, there isn’t any loss of data). 
                        Fragmentation is advantageous as it doesn’t create copies of data, consistency is not a problem.
